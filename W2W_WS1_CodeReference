Creating, reading, manipulating text files
Creating text files
touch this_file.txt
ls
rm this_file.txt
echo "first_string" > this_file.txt
cat this_file.txt
echo "second_string" >> this_file.txt
cat this_file.txt
cp this_file.txt ./copy_file.txt
cat copy_file.txt
rm this_file.txt copy_file.txt

Reading text files
cat annotated_neural_peaks.txt

head annotated_neural_peaks.txt
head -30 annotated_neural_peaks.txt
tail -30 annotated_neural_peaks.txt
less annotated_neural_peaks.txt
# How many words are on in our peaks file?
wc annotated_neural_peaks.txt
# How many peaks are in our file?
wc -l annotated_neural_peaks.txt
